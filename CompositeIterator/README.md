# Breaking News: Objectville Diner, Pancake House and Cafe Merge

Great news again! After those delicious pancake breakfasts at the Pancake House and those yummy lunches at the Diner all in one place now we have another problem...

They want to add a Cafe menu and they also want to add a separate Dessert menu to the Diner.

We want to implement a client that uses all those menus and menus inside menus.

Imagine you have been hired by the new company formed by the merger of the Diner, the Pancake House and the Cafe to create a C#-enabled waitress.

The spec for the C#-enabled waitress specifies that she can print a custom menu for customers on demand, and even tell you if a menu item is vegetarian without having to ask the cook — now that’s an innovation!

# Requirements

C#-enabled Waitress: code-name "Alice"

PrintAll() - prints every item on the menu

PrintVegetarianMenu() - prints all vegetarian menu items

IsItemVegetarian(name) - given the name of an item, returns true if the item is vegetarian, otherwise returns false
