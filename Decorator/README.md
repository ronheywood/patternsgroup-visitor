# Welcome to Starbuzz Coffee

Starbuzz Coffee has made a name for ourselves as the fastest growing coffee shop around.  If you’ve seen one on your local corner, look across the street; you’ll see another one. Because we're growing so quickly, we’re scrambling to update our ordering systems to match our beverage offerings. 

In addition to your coffee, you can also ask for several condiments like steamed milk, soy, and mocha (otherwise known as chocolate), and have it all topped off with whipped milk.  Starbuzz charges 0.25 currency units for each of these, but we really need to get them built into our order system.

We had a crack at it, but as you can see from the Condiments test - we quickly realised it was going to get complicated very quickly.

# Requirements

When the user selects a Coffee blend 
And the user adds one or more condiments
Then the order total should be added up correctly on the order

# Constraints
You may not alter any of the files in the Beverages namespace, and the Store class must always take a list of Beverage for the coffee menu.

You can make any changes you need to the files in the Condiments namespace or the other classes, and add new classes to these.
