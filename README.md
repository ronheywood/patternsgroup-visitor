# Visitor Pattern

This is a sample application with tests
used while discussing the Visitor Pattern during a Gang Of Four pattens group session.

The Airport will direct passengers into different locations depending on their ticket type
Economy, Premium Economy, Business or First Class

From arrival at the airport in the passenger goes to a check in desk, then to a departure lounge
then to a boarding gate and finally to the plane where complimentary drinks are served

# Usage
The behaviour is described in tests, 
Users should be able to refactor the many switch statements 
into Visitor Pattern and see the tests continue to pass
